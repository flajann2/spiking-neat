-- | Izhikevich neuron state: membrane potential and recovery variable.
-- `v` and `u` are the two state variables of the model — everything else (a, b, c, d) just shapes how they interact.
-- 
-- **v — membrane potential**
-- This is the actual voltage across the neuron's membrane, in millivolts. It's the variable that spikes. The equation
-- 
-- ```
-- v' = 0.04v² + 5v + 140 - u + I
-- ```
-- 
-- is a fitted quadratic (Izhikevich reverse-engineered the coefficients 0.04, 5, 140 to match real cortical neuron dynamics using far less computation than Hodgkin-Huxley). The quadratic term is what gives you the fast upstroke of a spike — once `v` crosses a certain point the `0.04v²` term dominates and `v` shoots up toward +30 mV essentially in finite time, which is why the model needs the explicit `if v ≥ 30` reset rather than a smooth repolarization phase like Hodgkin-Huxley has. `I` is your injected/synaptic input current — the thing you'd drive with external stimulation.
-- 
-- **u — membrane recovery variable**
-- This isn't a real physical quantity in the way `v` is — it's a lumped abstraction standing in for the slow ionic currents that oppose depolarization, mainly K⁺ activation and Na⁺ inactivation. Its job is negative feedback: it grows in response to spiking (via the `+d` reset) and subtracts from `v`'s growth (the `-u` term), which is what eventually pulls the neuron back down and creates a refractory-like period.
-- 
-- The `a(bv - u)` dynamics mean `u` chases `bv` at rate `a` — so `u` is always lagging behind a scaled version of `v`, which is exactly the "slow feedback trailing a fast variable" structure that makes delay embedding work.
-- 
-- **Why this matters for your delay embedding**
-- 
-- Your choice of `(v(t), u(t), v(t-τ))` is interesting because `v` is fast/spiky and `u` is slow/smooth — they already form a natural fast-slow pair, similar to how the Lorenz system has a fast variable and slower ones. Using `v(t-τ)` as a stand-in for a third independent dimension works because `v` alone doesn't have enough memory in it to unfold the attractor (the spike reset destroys information), but `u` partially compensates since it integrates spike history. You'll likely see the reset rule show up as a visible discontinuity or fold in the embedded trajectory — worth watching for when `v` hits 30 and jumps to `c`, since that's a non-smooth event that a pure delay-embedding of a smooth ODE wouldn't have.

-- | One 1ms integration step: two 0.5ms half-steps for v (stability near the
--   v^2 spike-threshold nonlinearity), one full step for u, then reset on spike.
-- The Izhikevich model boils a spiking neuron down to two coupled ODEs plus a reset rule:
-- 
-- ```
-- v' = 0.04v² + 5v + 140 - u + I
-- u' = a(bv - u)
-- if v ≥ 30: v ← c, u ← u + d
-- ```
-- 
-- Here's what each parameter does:
-- 
-- **a — recovery time scale**
-- Controls how fast `u` (the recovery variable) responds to changes in `v`. Small `a` (like 0.02) means slow recovery, so the neuron can sustain longer depolarizations or exhibit bursting. Larger `a` (like 0.1) means fast recovery, which tends to produce fast-spiking behavior.
-- 
-- **b — sensitivity of recovery to subthreshold voltage**
-- Controls how strongly `u` is coupled to `v` below threshold. Larger `b` makes `u` track `v` more tightly, which can produce low-threshold oscillations or resonator behavior. If `b < a`, you tend to get regular spiking/integrator dynamics; if `b > a`, you get resonator dynamics (the neuron responds preferentially to a certain input frequency).
-- 
-- **c — reset voltage**
-- After a spike, `v` snaps back to `c` (typically around -65 mV). More negative `c` gives a bigger after-spike hyperpolarization — this is one of the knobs that shapes bursting vs. tonic firing.
-- 
-- **d — after-spike jump in recovery**
-- After a spike, `u` gets bumped up by `d`. This is the key bursting/adaptation control — larger `d` means the recovery variable accumulates more with each spike, suppressing subsequent spikes and producing chattering or bursting patterns. Small `d` gives more regular tonic spiking.
-- 
-- **The classic combos** (from Izhikevich's 2003 paper) are worth having on hand since they map cleanly onto neuron classes:
-- - Regular spiking (RS): a=0.02, b=0.2, c=-65, d=8
-- - Intrinsically bursting (IB): a=0.02, b=0.2, c=-55, d=4
-- - Chattering (CH): a=0.02, b=0.2, c=-50, d=2
-- - Fast spiking (FS): a=0.1, b=0.2, c=-65, d=2
-- - Low-threshold spiking (LTS): a=0.02, b=0.25, c=-65, d=2
-- 
-- For your phase portrait visualizer, sweeping `d` while
-- holding the rest fixed is a nice way to show the qualitative transition
-- from tonic to bursting in the `(v, u, v(t-τ))` embedding — the bursts
-- show up as the trajectory looping through a slower,
-- larger-amplitude excursion before returning to the fast spike manifold.
